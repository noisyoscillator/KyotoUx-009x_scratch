1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,560
In this plot, you will learn about the random walk,

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:21,440
and see how it is a very basic but illuminating example of a stochastic process.

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,840
After summarizing the necessary theoretical knowledge

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,620
that we have already learned in the course,

5
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,500
we will conduct computer simulations of a random walk

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,060
and perform a stochastic analysis of the results.

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,320
At the end of this plot,

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:50,420
we will understand the close relationship between a random walk and the diffusion process.

9
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,420
Because a "random walk" is translated in Japanese as "drunken steps,"

10
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:00,860
I will use this analogy to explain the random walk process.

11
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,880
Imagine that

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,200
a drunken man is wandering around town after a heavy night of drinking.

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,900
He is completely disoriented

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,260
with no clue as to how to get home.

15
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,260
At each step, he loses memory of which direction he was going,

16
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:25,260
and chooses a new random direction in which to move.

17
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:32,640
For simplicity, we will consider the 1−D version of this random walk.

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,840
Thus, at each step, the drunken man has two options.

19
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,600
He can either take a step to the left or to the right.

20
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,160
At each step he is basically flipping a coin

21
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,300
to determine in which direction to move.

22
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:58,140
Thus, we set s_i = −1 or 1,

23
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,380
to be the stochastic variable that determines the i-th step,

24
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:16,740
where s_i=−1 means a step to the left and +1 to the right.

25
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:23,600
After "m" such steps, the location of the man is given by "l,"

26
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:33,320
and is equal to the sum of all s_i from i = 0 to m.

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:39,760
Assuming he was initially at the origin,

28
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,040
l = 0 at m = 0,

29
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,900
our aim is to calculate the probability distribution function P(l,m)

30
00:02:50,900 --> 00:03:04,240
of finding the drunken man at a location l after m steps.

31
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,960
As you probably realized,

32
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,960
we can evaluate P(l,m) in terms of the binomial distribution function.

33
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,100
To this end, we introduce two new variables,

34
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:25,120
namely n+, the total number of steps to the right,

35
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,380
and n−, the total number of steps to the left.

36
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:39,240
Then, the total number of steps m is represented as "n+" + "n−,"

37
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:47,800
and the current location l is represented as n+" – "n−."

38
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:58,920
Solving for n+ and n− in terms of m and l, we obtain Eq. (E1).

39
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,980
Using n+ or n−,

40
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,440
the probability distribution function P(l,m) can be estimated using

41
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,280
the binomial distribution function P_Binomial

42
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,480
of obtaining n+ right steps in m total steps,

43
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:26,860
or equivalently, obtaining n− left steps in m steps.

44
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,040
We already know that

45
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:38,100
such probabilities are given explicitly by the form of Eq. (E3).

46
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:45,120
When n+ and m are much larger than 1,

47
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:55,140
we know that the binomial distribution function converges to the normal distribution given in Eq. (E4)

48
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:07,280
with the average and variance of n+ given in Eqs. (E5) and (E6).

49
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:15,060
Recall that n+ is equal to (m+l)/2.

50
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:28,020
Thus, the binomial distribution function appearing in Eq. (E4) can be rewritten as Eq. (E7),

51
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,040
this time as a function of l.

52
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:43,660
Therefore, the desired probability distribution function P(l,m) is obtained as Eq. (E9)

53
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:52,700
with the average and variance for l given by Eqs. (E10) and (E11).

54
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,760
Now let us perform computer simulations

55
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:04,800
for a random walk using a random number generator to generate the steps of the walk.

56
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:16,680
First, import the numerical and graphical libraries as usual.

57
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,440
The main part of the simulation code is shown here.

58
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,260
In the beginning, we set p = 0.5,

59
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:33,700
which represents a drunken man with equal probability for moving right or left.

60
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:40,540
Then, set the number of total steps M=1,000

61
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:49,100
and the number of independent random walkers N=100,000.

62
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:57,060
The average and the standard deviation for the final location "l" after "M" steps are

63
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:04,280
calculated using Eqs. (E10) and (E11).

64
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,000
We create a location array L of size N,

65
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:18,600
which will contain the final position for all of the N independent drunken men.

66
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,320
After initializing the location array L to zero,

67
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:30,260
assuming the initial position is the same for all of them,

68
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:37,320
we generate a random sampling of steps for each of the men.

69
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:43,720
The M steps for each walk are randomly chosen from -1 or +1,

70
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:54,340
and stored as a variable "step" in the 10th line.

71
00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:02,560
Then, we calculate the final location l by accumulating all of the steps,

72
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:13,080
and storing the result in the L array at line 11 of the code.

73
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:21,640
This procedure of generating the M steps and then adding them to obtain the final location

74
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:29,100
is repeated N times, once for each drunken man.

75
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:37,680
This is achieved by the for loop which starts at line 9.

76
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:46,400
Notice the indentation of the code for lines 10 and 11

77
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,660
to indicate that they are performed inside the for loop.

78
00:08:52,660 --> 00:09:00,740
The remaining part of the code is just used to draw the plots of the histogram for "l,"

79
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:06,500
as well as the expected Gaussian distribution.

80
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,020
By running this code example,

81
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:31,720
you see that the probability distribution function P(l,m) is perfectly represented by Eqs. (E9) to (E11).

82
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,780
You may repeat the same simulation by choosing different values of total steps,

83
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:45,880
for example, M=100, 1000, 10000, and 100000

84
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:56,320
to see how the distribution changes with the total number of steps.

85
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,120
Let us next discuss how the random walk can be connected to the diffusion constant D.

86
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,860
To this end, we define two constants, namely

87
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:14,740
the length of a single step "a" and the time between subsequent steps t_s.

88
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:26,200
Here we consider a drift free case where p=0.5 and thus the average of "l" is 0.

89
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:37,100
Using "a" and t_s, we define the position of the random walker as x,

90
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:46,500
which is equal to "a" multiplied with the current location "l,"

91
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,300
and the duration of time for making m steps as "t,"

92
00:10:52,300 --> 00:11:01,680
which is equal to t_s multiplied with the number of total steps "m."

93
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:08,320
Taking care of the normalization as shown in Eq. (E12),

94
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:23,440
the probability distribution function P(l,m) can be converted to P(x,t) as shown in Eqs. (E13) to (E16).

95
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:31,380
Note that the variance of the position x is now given as a function of time t,

96
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:39,160
and not in terms of the number of steps m.

97
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:51,500
Now, let us turn our attention to the diffusion equation shown in Eq. (E17) with a diffusion constant D.

98
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:58,940
As initial condition we assume a delta distribution centered at the origin.

99
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:08,480
This means that all the walkers or diffusing particles are located at the origin.

100
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:17,880
If we solve this diffusion equation using the initial condition shown in Eq. (E18),

101
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,780
the solution is given by Eq. (E19),

102
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:28,440
which has an identical form to Eq. (E14).

103
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,020
You can convince yourselves that this is indeed a solution

104
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:45,620
by computing the time derivative and the second spatial derivative and verifying that Eq. (E17) is satisfied.

105
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:51,080
By comparing Eqs. (E14) and (E19),

106
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,700
we finally obtain the following general formula

107
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:10,400
which relates the diffusion constant D and the variance of the position of random walkers σ^2,

108
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:16,280
which is also referred to as the mean square displacement.
