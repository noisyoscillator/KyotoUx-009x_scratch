1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:18,080
In the previous plot, we already see that the diffusion constant of Brownian particles is determined through

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,420
the long-time limit of the mean square displacements.

3
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,920
In this plot, we derive the definition of the diffusion constant

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,860
in an alternative way using the linear response theory.

5
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:36,020
The result is an example of the so-called Green-Kubo formula,

6
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,920
which can define transport coefficients

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:45,660
in terms of equilibrium correlation functions of corresponding variables.

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:54,360
Let us consider a Brownian particle under the influence of an external drift force in the x-direction.

9
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,040
The Langevin equation we introduced in the previous plot is simply modified by

10
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:07,200
adding the external force on the right hand side as shown in Eq. (41).

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,540
Understanding how a system "responds" to such an external force or perturbation provides

12
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,140
valuable information on the dynamical properties of the system.

13
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,360
This is precisely what linear response theory allows us to do.

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,860
It measures the response of the system to an external perturbation,

15
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:40,240
under the assumption that the response is linear in this perturbation.

16
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,240
The first question we want to ask is

17
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,780
how does the system reach a steady state under this external force.

18
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,920
Thus, we take the steady state average of Eq. (41),

19
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,340
in the limit where the force is held constant for infinitely long time.

20
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:03,660
The limit of each term in Eq. (41) is given by the following equations.

21
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:10,300
By definition, the change in velocity should be zero in the steady state.

22
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,280
This means that the velocity is constant

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,100
and it should be exactly zero along the y and z directions.

24
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,960
Thanks to the properties of the random force,

25
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,220
its average should also be zero.

26
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,100
Finally, since the external force is constant,

27
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:38,640
its average is simply F_0 in the x direction.

28
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Thus, we see that we only need to consider the dynamics along the x direction

29
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,920
since motion along y and z will average out to zero.

30
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,780
Taking the long time average of Eq. (41) on both sides,

31
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,960
we see that the steady-state drift velocity is given by F_0

32
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,900
divided by the friction constant zeta.

33
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,780
Then, using the Einstein relation,

34
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,020
we can rewrite the steady-state velocity in terms of the diffusion coefficient

35
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,460
and the thermal energy as shown in Eq. (42).

36
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:24,700
Finally, solving for D we obtain Eq. (43).

37
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,620
This tells us that the diffusion constant can also be obtained from

38
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,960
the steady-state velocity of a particle driven by an external force trough a fluid.

39
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:44,300
In contrast, in the previous plot we derived the diffusion coefficient

40
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:52,000
in terms of the mean-squared displacement of a particle diffusing in a fluid.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,200
Let us now introduce the basics of linear response theory.

42
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,700
Its formal derivation is not treated in this course,

43
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,820
but can be found in several text books including

44
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,140
"Basic concepts for simple and complex liquids,"

45
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:13,600
and "Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics."

46
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,580
In the linear response theory,

47
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:25,040
we assume that the system is evolving in time with an equilibrium Hamiltonian H_0.

48
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,420
Then, an external force F(t) is applied to the system,

49
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,080
which gives rise to change in the Hamiltinan,

50
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:41,580
from H_0 to H_0+H'(t).

51
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:50,460
H'(t) is the energy gain describing the coupling of the external force to the system.

52
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:57,040
By definition, H' is written as -A*F(t),

53
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:04,380
and A is said to be the conjugate variable to F.

54
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:15,860
Now, consider how the average of a dynamical variable B changes under the external perturbation H'.

55
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:25,520
Let the average of B at equilibirum, under H_0, be denoted as B_0.

56
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:31,620
Under the perturbed Hamiltonian, H_0 + H',

57
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:40,760
the average of B at time t will deviate from B_0 by an amount of Delta B.

58
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,000
Here, we stress that

59
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:51,380
B_0 is calculated as an average over the original Hamiltonian H_0,

60
00:05:51,380 --> 00:06:02,380
whereas the deviation Delta B is calculated over the perturbed Hamiltonian.

61
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,120
Using linear response theory,

62
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:15,440
we can compute the time evolution of Delta B, provided that the external force is "small" enough.

63
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,460
Then, to the first order in the perturbation,

64
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:25,240
the time evolution of Delta B, under the external force F,

65
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:32,160
is given by a convolution of Phi_BA and F.

66
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,180
Where Phi_BA is the response function,

67
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:46,960
and the integral is taken from -infinity to t.

68
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,640
This result is extremely useful,

69
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:59,160
because Eq. (44) predicts the temporal value of B under the influence of an external force solely

70
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:07,820
from the equilibrium properties of the system in the absence of any external forces!

71
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,700
Notice that, as given in Eq. (45),

72
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:19,580
the response function is defined as the cross correlation function of A dot and B

73
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,540
under equilibrium Hamiltonian.

74
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:31,140
We see that linear response theory allows us to connect averages at equilibrium, under H_0,

75
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:38,380
with averages out of equilibrium, under H_0 + H'.

76
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:46,460
As an example, let us revisit the problem of calculating the self-diffusion constant of a particle,

77
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,380
now using linear response theory.

78
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:55,100
Assume that we have a single particle at equilibrium in a fluid.

79
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,440
At time t=0, we turn on an external potential,

80
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,720
which applies a constant external force on the particle.

81
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:13,340
Without loss of generality, we can set the force to act along the x-direction

82
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:20,700
and define the coordinates such that R = 0 at t = 0.

83
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:28,040
Mathematically, this force is represented as a constant amplitude F_0

84
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:34,420
multiplied with the Heaviside step function Theta(t)

85
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:38,040
which equals to 1 for t larger than 0,

86
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:45,140
and 0 otherwise, as illustrated in the figure.

87
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,260
The change in energy, the perturbation Hamiltonian H',

88
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,920
is given by the work done on the system by the external force.

89
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:03,340
By definition, this is equal to the force times the distance traveled.

90
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,980
Thus, A = R_x.

91
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:16,520
Since the response function depends on A-dot which is R-dot thus V,

92
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:27,480
lets take B equals to V to obtain the response in terms of the velocity autocorrelation function.

93
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:34,080
From the linear response function Eqs. (44) and (45),

94
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,220
the drift velocity under the perturbed Hamiltonian H_0+H'

95
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:48,140
is represented by the time integral of the velocity autocorrelation function from zero to t

96
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:53,200
since F=0 for t less than 0.

97
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,380
Even though we assumed a constant force along the x-direction,

98
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:09,180
this can be generalized to an arbitrary direction to give the general form in expression (46).

99
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,720
In the figure we have illustrated the time evolution of the drift velocity

100
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:23,980
after the application of external drift force at t=0.

101
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,900
Finally, from Eqs. (43) and (46),

102
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,500
the self diffusion constant of the Brownian particle is obtained by

103
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,520
taking the limit when t goes to infinity.

104
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:45,460
Linear response theory allows us to replace the average over the perturbed system

105
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,120
with a different average over the unperturbed system.

106
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:56,880
The final result is shown as Eq. (47).

107
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,720
This is an example of the so-called Green-Kubo formula,

108
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,080
which can define transport coefficients

109
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:11,040
in terms of equilibrium correlation functions of corresponding variables.

110
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,340
Here we have computed the Diffusion coefficient

111
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:21,080
in terms of the velocity auto-correlation function of an equilibrium system!
