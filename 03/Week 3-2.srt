1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,600
In this plot, we study basic theories of Brownian motion.

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,600
Let us start with writing down the celebrated Langevin equation

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,760
that describes the Brownian motion of a particle diffusing in a fluid.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,700
Consider a spherical particle of radius $a$ and mass $m$ in a solvent fluid.

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,740
Assuming the size of the Brownian particle is much larger than the size of the fluid molecules,

6
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,960
we can treat the fluid as a continuum medium with viscosity $\eta$.

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:52,340
Let $R(t)$ be the temporal position of the particle at time $t$ and $V$ its velocity.

8
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,900
To write down Newton's equation of motion for the Brownian particle,

9
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:06,040
the mass times acceleration should equal the total force acting on the particle.

10
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:17,200
First, if a body is moving relative to a fluid, it experiences a friction force, colored in blue,

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:29,160
which will be proportional to the velocity with the constant of proportionality called the friction constant $\zeta$.

12
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:40,260
For a spherical particle the friction constant $\zeta$ is given by $6\pi\eta a$, known as the Stokes law.

13
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,180
And second, in addition to the friction force,

14
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:54,560
we know that there must be another type of force which gives rise to the irregular motion of the Brownian particle.

15
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,980
We call this the random force $F(t)$ colored in red,

16
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:12,140
which represents the effects of the many collisions taking place between the Brownian particle and the fluid molecules.

17
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:23,900
Finally, by putting all of them together, we can write down the Langevin equation shown here as Eq.(21).

18
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,260
Now, let us characterize this random force in more detail.

19
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,560
Assuming three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates,

20
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,840
the random force has three components along the x, y, and z directions.

21
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:55,840
Without loss of generality, we can assume that the average of the force along any direction is zero as shown in Eq.(22).

22
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:03,120
If this was not the case, we could always separate the non-zero part as an extra drift force

23
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,740
to be added separately in the Langevin equation.

24
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:17,380
We still need to specify how the forces at different times, or along different directions are correlated.

25
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:25,240
We note that we are interested in the dynamics of the Brownian particle at time scales

26
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:32,100
much larger than the time-scales of the collisions with the fluid molecules.

27
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:42,100
Therefore, we can assume that the successive random forces are uncorrelated on the time scale of the Brownian particle.

28
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:55,880
This is expressed mathematically in Eq.(23) using the auto-correlation function for the random force.

29
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:11,800
Here, $\delta of \alpha\beta$ is the Kroenecker's delta, it is $1$ if $\alpha = \beta$ and zero otherwise.

30
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:27,220
$\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta function, it is zero everywhere except at the origin t=0, where it diverges.

31
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:35,340
The crucial point is that the integral of the delta function equals to one.

32
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:45,100
Noise which obeys equations (22) and (23) is called white noise or the Gaussian noise.

33
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:54,380
Now, let us calculate the power spectrum of the random force $F(t)$.

34
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:03,380
Using the Wiener-Kintchine theorem, we can write the power spectrum S_F (\omega)

35
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:11,300
in terms of the random force auto-correlation function ¥phi_F(t).

36
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,960
Using the properties of the white noise,

37
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:25,860
this auto-correlation Eq.(23) is proportional to a delta function, which kills the integral.

38
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:36,420
Thus, we arrive at the simple result that the power spectrum is a constant proportional to D tilde,

39
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:43,020
which determines the amplitude of the random force in Eq. (23).

40
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:52,640
Let us try and see what the power spectrum and correlation functions look like.

41
00:05:52,640 --> 00:06:04,420
On the left, we plot the power spectrum of the random force, on the right the auto-correlation function.

42
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:19,740
S_F(\omega) is a constant, as we have just proved, and \phi(t) is proportional to a delta function.

43
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:27,200
Next, let us characterize the properties of the particle velocity $V$.

44
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,040
Taking the Fourier transform of the Langevin equation Eq (1),

45
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:38,860
we obtain a simple algebraic equation for V(\omega).

46
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:47,620
This can be easily solved, to give the following equation for V(\omega) as a function of F(\omega).

47
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,520
Now, we are in a position to calculate the power spectrum of the velocity.

48
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:03,220
By definition, S_V(\omega) is given by the square norm of the Fourier transform of the velocity.

49
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,920
Writing $V(\omega)$ in terms of $F(\omega)$, and using Eq.(24)

50
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:16,060
for the power spectrum of the random forces, we obtain Eq.(25).

51
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:27,000
We note that the form of this equation appears so often in Physics and Mathematics that it has its own name.

52
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,660
It is the Lorentzian function.

53
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,900
Once we have computed the power spectrum,

54
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:44,320
we can use the Wiener-Khintchine theorem to obtain the velocity auto-correlation function.

55
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,160
In the last step, we have used a well known-result,

56
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:57,940
that the Fourier transform of a Lorentzian is a two-sided decaying exponential.

57
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:08,700
This means that it is an even function of time t, and therefore depends only on the absolute value of t.

58
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,440
You can look this up in any table of integrals,

59
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:22,060
use a computer algebra system, or do it yourself by hand using Cauchy's integral formula.

60
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:32,760
Let us now visualize the previously derived results for the velocity of the Brownian particle.

61
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:40,280
On the left, we have the Lorentzian function describing the Power spectrum,

62
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:52,660
and on the right we have the two-sided decaying exponential which gives us the auto-correlation of the velocities.

63
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,600
With the results we have obtained so far,

64
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:03,480
we are in a position to derive a useful relation named the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

65
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:14,960
Setting t=0 in Eq.(26), we obtain a simple expression for the average squared velocity:

66
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:23,400
it is proportional to D tilde, and inversely proportional to \zeta and m.

67
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:30,300
Furthermore, using the equipartition theorem of classical statistical mechanics,

68
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:40,900
we also know that this average should be equal to 3 times kbT divided by m,

69
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:45,640
where kb is the Boltzmann constant.

70
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:52,620
Solving for D tilde, we finally obtain the fluctuation-dissipation theorem,

71
00:09:52,620 --> 00:10:03,460
which relates the amplitude of the fluctuating random forces with the magnitude of the dissipative friction forces.

72
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:12,840
Let us now turn our attention to looking at the temporal particle positions or displacements,

73
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,780
in order to characterize its diffusive motion.

74
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:31,000
By definition, the displacement of the particle after some time $t$ can be expressed as the time integral of the velocity V from 0 to t.

75
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,380
The mean square displacement of the particle is defined as in this equation.

76
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:43,740
By rewriting the displacement as a time integral of the velocity,

77
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:51,340
we are left with a double integral of the auto-correlation function of the velocity,

78
00:10:51,340 --> 00:11:01,800
which has been calculated in Eq.(26), at two distinct times, t_1 and t_2.

79
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,880
The integral can be performed analytically,

80
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:17,300
but care must be taken to properly handle the absolute value that appears in the exponential.

81
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,920
We have drawn the integration domain on the right.

82
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,640
The blue outline gives the original integration limits for t1 and t2,

83
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,660
which is represented by a square domain of side length t.

84
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:45,980
Since the function we are integrating depends only on the absolute value of $t_2 – t_1$,

85
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,160
we can divide this domain into an upper triangular part,

86
00:11:51,160 --> 00:12:01,480
the red region, where t_2 is larger than t_1, and a lower triangular part where t_1 is larger than t2.

87
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:09,600
Note that the value of the integral over the upper triangular domain must be equal to

88
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,640
the value of the integral over the lower domain,

89
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:22,380
and it should be half of the integral over the square domain.

90
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:34,920
Thus, we can rearrange the integration limits to go only over the red domain, where t_2 is larger than t1.

91
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:42,740
With this, we can get rid of the annoying absolute value from the equation,

92
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:52,600
and the integrals over t1 and t2 can now be separated and easily performed.

93
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:03,040
After doing all this, we see that the mean square displacement is increasing lineally with time t.

94
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,880
At the end of the plot, we will define the self-diffusion constant of Brownian particles,

95
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:21,840
as the long-time limit of the mean-square displacement divided by 6 t.

96
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:32,780
We then obtain that the Diffusion constant is D tilde divided by \zeta^2 as shown in Eq.(30).

97
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:44,520
Using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem Eq.(29), we arrive at the Einstein relation shown as Eq.(31).

98
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:59,760
Finally, from the Einstein relation, together with the Stokes law, we obtain the Stokes-Einstein relation shown as Eq.(32),

99
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:07,320
which gives a good estimate for the self diffusion constant of spherical particles of radius a,

100
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,660
diffusing in a fluid of viscosity \eta at temperature T.
