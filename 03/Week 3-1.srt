1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:19,340
Brownian motion, the motion of small particles diffusing in a fluid, is highly stochastic in nature.

2
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:25,020
Therefore, such motions must be modeled as stochastic processes,

3
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,460
for which exact predictions are no longer possible.

4
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,440
This means that somewhat different mathematical methods

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,060
are needed to characterize and analyze stochastic processes.

6
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,680
Before defining what a stochastic process is,

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:51,540
let us give a familiar example of something that is not a stochastic process.

8
00:00:51,540 --> 00:01:04,560
Let X be given as some function of time t, such that we know the exact values of X at any given time t.

9
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,460
This is called a deterministic process.

10
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,140
Now let us consider a stochastic process Y(t).

11
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,940
Here, we can no longer specify Y as a function of time.

12
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,020
The only thing we can do is to talk about probabilities.

13
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,100
Instead of giving the value of Y at some time t,

14
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:37,960
we must specify the probability that the random variable has a value y at time t,

15
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:45,700
given that it had a value y_0 at time t_0.

16
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:55,100
If we were to draw several realizations of this process, we might end up with the trajectories drawn here.

17
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:03,900
For simplicity, we have only drawn the paths that go through y_0 at time t_0.

18
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,280
If we consider some later time t,

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:17,260
we see that Y can in principle have any value with a probability defined at the time t.

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:26,720
Finally, for the special case when the probabilities are invariant under a shift in time,

21
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,640
we say that the stochastic process is steady.

22
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:38,860
In such cases, only differences in time are important, not the absolute time values.

23
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:51,480
When studying stochastic processes, it is convenient to be able to go back and forth between real and Fourier space.

24
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,720
Consider that we have a steady stochastic process Y(t), with zero mean.

25
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:06,880
The Fourier transform is defined as Eq(1), and the inverse Fourier transform as Eq(2).

26
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:21,880
Where we have assumed that the process Y_T is defined over a time range T, from –T/2 to +T/2,

27
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:37,260
by multiplying the original process Y with a windowing box function such that Y_T = Y inside the range, and zero outside.

28
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,160
And later time, we will take the limit of T goes to +infty.

29
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:50,100
This is required in order to properly define the Fourier transform.

30
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:58,220
For what follows, it will be useful to define the Spectral density

31
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:08,660
or power spectrum of a given stochastic process Y(t) rather than directly evaluating the probability function.

32
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:16,160
The spectrum density is defined in terms of the Fourier transform as Eq.(4).

33
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:29,080
This spectral density gives us the importance of the different frequency components or Fourier modes in the process.

34
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,840
As a first example, let us consider a purely deterministic process.

35
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:49,720
Let the time evolution of this process be given by a simple cosine wave, of frequency \omega_1, such that in Eq.(5).

36
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:57,960
There is no random component here, we know the precise value of Y at any given time t.

37
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:11,380
When we calculate the power spectrum, we get a single delta peak, centered at \omega_1, with amplitude A^2.

38
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:21,800
This is not surprising, since we know that Y(t) contains only a single Fourier mode with frequency \omega_1.

39
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:32,860
As a second example, let us consider the case of White noise, which is purely stochastic.

40
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:40,880
On the left, we have a sample realization of a white noise with amplitude A.

41
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:50,740
From the path we can see that most values will lie within the range between –A and +A.

42
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,300
The signal looks very complicated, however,

43
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:05,380
a simpler representation can be obtained when you compute the power spectrum S(\omega),

44
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,720
which we have plotted on the right.

45
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:16,080
S(\omega) is just a constant, with amplitude A^2.

46
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,740
In other words, this process not only contains all frequencies,

47
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,820
but it contains them all in the same amount.

48
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,600
When studying stochastic process,

49
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:39,800
it is convenient to introduce a special class of functions called correlation functions.

50
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:54,440
They provide a measure of how related or correlated one or more dynamic variables are, over a separation time t.

51
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:05,180
For now, we only consider a single stochastic process Y(t), thus we deal with auto-correlation functions.

52
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:14,080
This auto-correlation function \phi(t) is defined in Eq.(9).

53
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,660
Imagine again several realizations of a stochastic process,

54
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:26,260
which pass through the same point at time \tau.

55
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,060
What do we know about Y at later times?

56
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:38,700
Assuming that the paths are continuous, we expect that for short times t,

57
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:50,320
Y at \tau + t will be very close to Y at ¥tau.

58
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:57,420
But what about for large values of t?

59
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:04,000
This is the information that the auto-correlation function gives us.

60
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:13,920
A typical example of this auto-correlation is plotted on the right.

61
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:27,400
At time t=0, \phi_Y(t=0) = Average(Y^2).

62
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:33,440
For "short" times we see a weak decay,

63
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,160
the correlation function does not change significantly,

64
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:46,700
but eventually, when t is large enough it finally goes to zero.

65
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:57,300
Thus, knowing the value of Y at some time t0 gives me some information of Y at future times.

66
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:06,560
But only for these "short" times, where the values are said to be correlated.

67
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:19,280
At larger times, my knowledge of Y at time t0 gives me no information as the auto-correlation function has decayed to zero,

68
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,860
meaning that the values are not correlated any more.

69
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,580
To get an idea of how the correlation function behaves,

70
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:40,280
let us consider again the case of the purely deterministic cosine wave process.

71
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:54,140
In this case, the auto-correlation function is a cosine with the amplitude of A^2/2, which never decays.

72
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:00,820
The meaning of this is clear, if we know the value of Y at any given time,

73
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,960
we know the value of Y at all times, as expected.

74
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,980
Now let us consider a more interesting case.

75
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,840
Going back to the white noise example.

76
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:29,520
By definition, we know that the value of Y at any given time t, is uncorrelated with the value of Y at any other time t'.

77
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:39,500
In other words, knowing the value of Y at time t, does not tell me anything about future or past values of Y.

78
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:46,080
This is exactly what we see when we calculate the autocorrelation function,

79
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:56,000
which is just a delta function centered at t=zero, with amplitude of A^2.

80
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:06,300
Using the definition of the correlation function Eq.(9) and the inverse Fourier transform Eq.(2),

81
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,000
we can derive the following useful theorem.

82
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:20,100
First, we express the value of Y at time t + \tau in terms of its Fourier components.

83
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:27,780
Second, we rearrange the integrals over \tau and \omega,

84
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:36,540
and write the exponential of the sum as a product of exponentials.

85
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:47,700
The inner-most integral is nothing more than the conjugate of the Fourier transform of Y(t)

86
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:55,620
which is Y(-\omega) defined as Y*(\omega).

87
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:11,240
Finally, we identify the term in parenthesis as the power spectrum of Y(\omega) that is S(\omega).

88
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:26,290
Thus, from Eq.(14) we immediately identify S(\omega) as the Fourier transform of the correlation function \phi(t).

89
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:33,270
This is an example of the famous Wiener-Khintchine theorem, which states that

90
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:40,170
“The autocorrelation function of a stationary stochastic process

91
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:50,630
is related to the spectral density or power spectrum of this process through a Fourier transform.“

92
00:12:50,640 --> 00:13:01,120
Inspection of equations (14) and (15) allows us to derive the following simple expressions for the correlation function

93
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:15,180
and power spectrum at zero time and frequency, represented by equations (16) and (17) respectively.

94
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,980
These are called sum rules.
